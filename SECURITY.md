## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this demo project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to [your-email@domain.com] with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- **Timeline**: We aim to address critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Best Practices

This is a demo application and should not be used in production without proper security review. If you're using this code as a reference:

1. **Never expose sensitive data** in client-side code
2. **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
3. **Validate all user inputs** on both client and server side
4. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
5. **Keep dependencies updated** and scan for vulnerabilities
6. **Implement proper error handling** that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Dependencies

We regularly update our dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. You can check for outdated packages by running:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```
